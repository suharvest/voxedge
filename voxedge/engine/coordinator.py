"""Backend execution coordinator (voxedge engine slot layer).

Copied/adapted from app/core/coordinator.py, dedup after Phase 1b.
The
"N=2 small-GPU doesn't crash" moat. stdlib-only (asyncio); no app imports.

Execution mode drives slot acquire:
  * concurrent  : no lock, ASR and TTS run in parallel.
  * serialized  : single asyncio.Lock shared by both slots; mutually
                  exclusive.
  * exclusive   : same lock + slot tracking; switching slot calls the
                  dormant backend's ``unload()`` before yielding. Best-effort:
                  backends not overriding ``unload()`` stay resident.

Backend capability is
the ceiling, the requested mode is the floor. ``concurrent`` is permitted only
when BOTH active backends declare a parallel-capable
``ConcurrencyCapability``. If either cannot run parallel, the mode is
downgraded to ``serialized``. ``exclusive`` is always honored as-is.

DECOUPLING vs app/core/coordinator.py:
  * The original lazily imported ``app.core.capability_resolver.resolve``
    (coordinator.py:43) and consulted a ``profile`` dict. voxedge instead
    constructs from live backend INSTANCES and uses
    ``voxedge.engine.capability_resolver.resolve`` (no profile, no env,
    no registry). No ``app.*`` import remains.
  * The module-level singleton (``init_coordinator`` / ``get_coordinator``,
    coordinator.py:99-113) is dropped — the engine owns its coordinator
    instance and passes it explicitly (no global state in the library).
